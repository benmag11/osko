- Shadcn componenents are used wherever possible. When working with shadcn components, follow these instructions:

Get a Demo First: Before using a component, you must call the get_component_demo(component_name) tool. This is critical for understanding how the component is used, its required props, and its structure.

Retrieve the Code:

For a single component, call get_component(component_name).

For a composite block, call get_block(block_name).

Implement Correctly: Integrate the retrieved code into the application, customizing it with the necessary props and logic to fulfill the user's requestsible, you should use the shadcn mcp server every time you are working with shadcn components.

# Session Context 1 - Authentication System Implementation

## Previous Work (UI Implementation)
Previously implemented the shadcn login-03 block for UI components including LoginForm and SignUpForm.

## Current Task Completed
Full sign up and sign in functionality with Supabase authentication has been implemented.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Auth Server Actions (src/app/auth/actions.ts)
- `signUp`: Creates new user account with email confirmation required
- `signIn`: Authenticates existing users with email/password
- `signOut`: Logs out users and clears session
- `getUser`: Gets current authenticated user from session

### 2. Auth Callback Route (src/app/auth/callback/route.ts)
- Handles email confirmation redirect from Supabase
- Exchanges auth code for session using exchangeCodeForSession
- Redirects to /subjects after successful confirmation

### 3. Subjects Page Route (src/app/subjects/page.tsx)
- Moved from "subjects dashboard.tsx" to proper route location
- Now accessible at /subjects URL
- Protected route requiring authentication via middleware

### 4. Updated Sign Up Form (src/components/auth/signup-form.tsx)
- Made form functional with server action integration
- Added 'use client' directive for client-side interactivity
- Added loading states with useFormStatus hook
- Added error handling and display
- Fixed link to sign in page (/auth/signin)
- Form redirects to email confirmation page after signup
- Added name attributes to inputs for form data

### 5. Updated Login Form (src/components/auth/login-form.tsx)
- Made form functional with server action integration
- Added 'use client' directive for client-side interactivity
- Added loading states with useFormStatus hook
- Added error handling and display
- Fixed link to sign up page (/auth/signup)
- Removed "Forgot password?" link (not implementing yet)
- Form redirects to /subjects after successful login
- Added name attributes to inputs for form data

### 6. Middleware (src/middleware.ts)
- Created middleware using Supabase SSR client
- Protects /subjects and /subject/* routes from unauthenticated access
- Redirects unauthenticated users to /auth/signin
- Redirects authenticated users away from auth pages to /subjects
- Handles cookie management for session persistence

### 7. Email Confirmation Page (src/app/auth/confirm/page.tsx)
- Shows message after signup to check email
- Provides link to sign up again if email not received
- Clear instructions for users to check spam folder
- Consistent branding with other auth pages

### 8. Fixed Branding
- Changed "Acme Inc." to "Exam Papers" in all auth pages
- Fixed logo links to redirect to home page (/)
- Consistent branding across signup, signin, and confirm pages

## Authentication Flow
1. **Sign Up**: User enters email/password → Server action creates account → Redirect to confirmation page
2. **Email Confirmation**: Supabase sends email → User clicks link → Redirected to /auth/callback
3. **Session Creation**: Callback exchanges code for session → User redirected to /subjects
4. **Sign In**: User enters credentials → Server action validates → Direct redirect to /subjects
5. **Protected Routes**: Middleware checks session → Redirects if unauthenticated

## Technical Details
- Using Supabase's built-in auth.users table (no custom user table needed)
- OAuth providers (Google/Apple) are UI placeholders only - not functional yet
- Email confirmation is required before first login
- Session managed via cookies (SSR compatible with Next.js 15)
- All protected routes require authentication via middleware
- Server actions used for form submissions (Next.js 15 pattern)
- Error states handled gracefully with user feedback

# Session Context 1 - Authentication System Implementation

## Previous Work (UI Implementation)
Previously implemented the shadcn login-03 block for UI components including LoginForm and SignUpForm.

## Current Task Completed
Full sign up and sign in functionality with Supabase authentication has been implemented.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Auth Server Actions (src/app/auth/actions.ts)
- `signUp`: Creates new user account with email confirmation required
- `signIn`: Authenticates existing users with email/password
- `signOut`: Logs out users and clears session
- `getUser`: Gets current authenticated user from session

### 2. Auth Callback Route (src/app/auth/callback/route.ts)
- Handles email confirmation redirect from Supabase
- Exchanges auth code for session using exchangeCodeForSession
- Redirects to /subjects after successful confirmation

### 3. Subjects Page Route (src/app/subjects/page.tsx)
- Moved from "subjects dashboard.tsx" to proper route location
- Now accessible at /subjects URL
- Protected route requiring authentication via middleware

### 4. Updated Sign Up Form (src/components/auth/signup-form.tsx)
- Made form functional with server action integration
- Added 'use client' directive for client-side interactivity
- Added loading states with useFormStatus hook
- Added error handling and display
- Fixed link to sign in page (/auth/signin)
- Form redirects to email confirmation page after signup
- Added name attributes to inputs for form data

### 5. Updated Login Form (src/components/auth/login-form.tsx)
- Made form functional with server action integration
- Added 'use client' directive for client-side interactivity
- Added loading states with useFormStatus hook
- Added error handling and display
- Fixed link to sign up page (/auth/signup)
- Removed "Forgot password?" link (not implementing yet)
- Form redirects to /subjects after successful login
- Added name attributes to inputs for form data

### 6. Middleware (src/middleware.ts)
- Created middleware using Supabase SSR client
- Protects /subjects and /subject/* routes from unauthenticated access
- Redirects unauthenticated users to /auth/signin
- Redirects authenticated users away from auth pages to /subjects
- Handles cookie management for session persistence

### 7. Email Confirmation Page (src/app/auth/confirm/page.tsx)
- Shows message after signup to check email
- Provides link to sign up again if email not received
- Clear instructions for users to check spam folder
- Consistent branding with other auth pages

### 8. Fixed Branding
- Changed "Acme Inc." to "Exam Papers" in all auth pages
- Fixed logo links to redirect to home page (/)
- Consistent branding across signup, signin, and confirm pages

## Authentication Flow
1. **Sign Up**: User enters email/password → Server action creates account → Redirect to confirmation page
2. **Email Confirmation**: Supabase sends email → User clicks link → Redirected to /auth/callback
3. **Session Creation**: Callback exchanges code for session → User redirected to /subjects
4. **Sign In**: User enters credentials → Server action validates → Direct redirect to /subjects
5. **Protected Routes**: Middleware checks session → Redirects if unauthenticated

## Technical Details
- Using Supabase's built-in auth.users table (no custom user table needed)
- OAuth providers (Google/Apple) are UI placeholders only - not functional yet
- Email confirmation is required before first login
- Session managed via cookies (SSR compatible with Next.js 15)
- All protected routes require authentication via middleware
- Server actions used for form submissions (Next.js 15 pattern)
- Error states handled gracefully with user feedback

## Files Created/Modified
### Created:
- src/app/auth/actions.ts
- src/app/auth/callback/route.ts
- src/app/subjects/page.tsx (moved from subjects dashboard.tsx)

- OAuth integration (Google/Apple)
- Email resend functionality
- User profile management

## Landing Page Removal - Completed

### Task
Complete removal of existing landing page to prepare for new implementation.

### What Was Removed
1. **Landing Page Components**
   - Deleted entire `src/components/landing/` directory containing:
     - navigation.tsx - Top navigation with sign in/sign up buttons
     - hero-section.tsx - Main hero content with "It's Studyclix... But it's free" messaging
     - cta-buttons.tsx - Call-to-action buttons with broken links to /signup and /login

2. **Landing Page Assets**
   - Deleted `public/logo.svg` - Only used in landing navigation
   - Deleted `public/hero-image.webp` - Unused landing page asset
   - Note: `landing-page-banner.svg` referenced in code was not found in public directory

3. **Empty Directories**
   - Deleted `src/app/signup/` - Empty directory with no files

4. **Main Landing Page**
   - Replaced `src/app/page.tsx` with minimal placeholder:
     ```tsx
     export default function HomePage() {
       return (
         <main className="min-h-screen">
           {/* Landing page to be implemented */}
         </main>
       )
     }
     ```

### Preserved Elements
- All authentication pages remain fully functional:
  - `/auth/signin`
  - `/auth/signup`
  - `/auth/confirm`
  - `/auth/callback`
- All auth-related components and functionality intact
- Links to "/" in auth pages kept as-is for future landing page
- All shared UI components (Button, etc.) preserved as they're used elsewhere
- Subject pages and all other functionality unchanged

### Current State
- Landing page at "/" now shows empty placeholder
- Authentication system fully operational but not directly accessible via UI
- Ready for new landing page implementation
- No broken imports or dependencies
